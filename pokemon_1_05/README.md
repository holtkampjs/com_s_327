# 1.05

During assignment 1.04, I sunk a lot of extra time into learning how to use ncurses. I had my girlfriend help me set up the RGB for colors and it helped me feel good about my color palate. During the last assignment, I ran it down to the minute losing sleep and it felt like I had squandered my time. This project proved to me that I didn't. 

Starting with the solution code from project 1.04, I replaced the printing code with the ncurses printing logic I had for the last project. Afterwards, I began reading the solution code to determine how in the game loop to apply the logic for this assignment. Adding the commands was pretty easy once I read the code that moved the npc's. Next, I applied windows for each instance in which you would interact with a trainer list, pokemart, pokecenter, or battle. I opted to leave some of the map visible as if it was a popup window. I was able to see an example via an ncurses tutorial but all it gave me was how to make an independent window and interact with it. Scrolling in the trainer list may be the most challenging part of this assignment for me. In my implementation, this part as well as window positioning has a lot of "magic numbers", but for this assignment, I don't really care. The one bug I have that is persisting is that when escaping from windows, you need to hit escape two times rather than once. I do not at the moment understand why but it isn't that difficult compared to hitting the button once.
