Feb 07: Rewriting terrain generation code
Feb 08: Finished rewriting terrain generation
        Altered map generation initialization
        Got navigation and test code interfacing with terrain code successfully
Feb 09: Struggling with pass by reference working inconsistently
Feb 10: Found bug
        Added map navigation functionality
        Added edge of world
        (Shhh drank beer till 4am to push through frustrations and fully intend on being in class today)
        Banged head against wall (figuratively this time)
        Can finally go to bed in peace
