# Assigment 1.02

## Joseph Holtkamp

Hi, it is late and I have completed this assigment to what I feel is acceptable enough. The biggest bug I faced was that GDB does not display the correct values for the parameters passed to it when it displays the function call. This kept me on a loop for 5+ hours. Luckily, I figured it out and that gave me the motivation to push through my frustrations with Blue Moon and Five Finger Death Punch and Drayton Farley on my side.

I am proud of my product as I simply let players fall off of the map rather than giving them an endless world or some other warning. If someone is stupid enough to fall off of the world, they got what was coming. Hey at least its less painful than dying of papercuts (I imagine, I myself have not died). I did learn a bit by incorperating the code from Prof. Shaeffer on the last assigment in this assignment and I am thankful for the flexible deadlines. What it costs my sleep and mental wellbeing is worth it for my grade and personal satisfaction.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy my commentary as my grader. If you feel so inclined, please laugh about this with your friends or reach out to me, whatever. I'm generally pretty easy going, but this assigment had its fair amount of cuss words aimed its way, even though they were more caused by my own ignorance.
