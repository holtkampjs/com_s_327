# 1.07 - Joseph Holtkamp

I don't have a lot to say for this one. I've spent many late nights on these projects and this one is looking to be too much for me to fit in this week. With projects piling up, I need to make some sacrifices and this week, it will be this project. To whoever grades this, don't feel bad about giving me a low score, I calculated the effect on my grade of a 0 and have made peace with it. Seeing that it's late/early in the morning, I don't feel like staying up as late as I have in the past. 

As far as what I learned in this project, I can start with the trivial: start earlier. Other than that, I've learned that I don't really understand pokemon. Really, I don't understand how to "query" a database that consists of multiple arrays of structs in C++. If you're looking at my code, I didn't get far, just a stub of a function titled encounter_pokemon(). The idea was that I would provide create a pokemon, display its info in a window from ncurses, etc.. This time I'll accept
defeat.
